## What is a Shell ?
An operating system shell is a computer program that provides relatively broad and direct access to the system on which it runs. The term shell refers to how it is a relatively thin layer around an operating system.
A shell is generally a command-line interface (CLI) program although some graphical user interface (GUI) programs are arguably classified as shells too.

## Why is better of bash ?
A project without leaks not like bash (the library readline leaks, it's normal).  

## Possibility of command :
```
ls
cat
echo $USER $SHLVL
cat << test << command << test > test.txt
< test.txt cat
var_name=var
env
export var_name+=iable
export
env
unset var_name
cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat | ls
env | grep PWD | wc -l
cd
env | grep PWD
cd -
env | grep PWD
cd ~
```
